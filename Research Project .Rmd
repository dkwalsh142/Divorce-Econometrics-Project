## Your Data set choice {.tabset}



### Data
This section has a maximum of 20 points. 
To earn the maximum number of points, you should answer the following three questions and your code should be clearly commented (what does each line of code produce).


Name the sources of your data and how they can be obtained. 

  - 

Discuss the units of measurement of the variables of interest.

  -
  
Explore the sample selection for your study. Make sure to show how you clean the data to prepare it for your analysis. Make sure you have a complete sample, i.e. a sample with no missing values or values which indicate missing values (e.g. 999)

```{r, echo=TRUE, evaluate=TRUE}

```

### Literature Review
This section has a maximum of 5 points. 
To earn maximum points make sure to summarize the findings for at least two journal articles. A paragraph summarizing the findings for each paragraph of each paper is enough. Make sure to properly cite the articles using APA format.Additionally provide a citation for 3 additionally articles that are relevant towards to study. 

  Article 1 summary
  
  - 
  
  Article 2 summary
  
  - 


Three additional relevant article citations

### Plot
This section has a maximum of 10 points. 
To earn the maximum number of points, you need to create a graph of your variable of interest using `ggplot`. The graph should have  title, legend, axis labels, and figure caption. Chose the type of graph that is most appropriate for your data, e.g. scatter plot, line graph, bar graph, box plot, etc.

```{r, echo=TRUE, evaluate=TRUE}


```

### Summary Statistics
This section has a maximum of 15 points.
To earn the maximum number of points, present summary statistics for the variables used in the analysis in a table (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of observations) and include a summary table with them. All categorical variables, variables that are not continuous (e.g., race, gender), need to be presented by category. The variables should have labelled clearly. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, evaluate=TRUE}


```

### Main Results
This section has a maximum  40 points.
To earn the maximum number of points, you need to answer the following questions:


Write the equation you estimate. 
  -

A convincing discussion of what variables to control for is essential. Are your results causal or not? Discuss potential concerns with omitted variables etc along with the consequences of those problems.

  -

 Present your results in a table that includes coefficients, standard error, R-squared and number of observations. The control variables should be added one by one, and the results should be reported in separate columns (number of observations should be constant, if not you may not have cleaned your data correctly)
 
 - 
 
 Write about the magnitude and interpretations of your coefficients. Are they statistically significant (includes significance levels in tables)? Do they have the expected sign (this may indicate a specification problem, for example, omitted variables)?

```{r, echo=TRUE, evaluate=TRUE}

```


### Identification Strategy
This section has a maximum of 10 points.
To earn the maximum number of points, discuss what identification strategy would be suitable for solving the endogeneity problem. If this is not possible, discuss why it is impossible to find an identification strategy.
You do not need to run the regression.


```{r, echo=TRUE, evaluate=TRUE}

```
